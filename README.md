### Overview  
Ring Road Weather is an application which allows users to view the current weather for cities along Iceland's ring road (Route 1). This was my final solo project for Mod3 at the Turing School of Software and Design. I was given 6 days to conceptualize an application which focused on a specific user to solve a problem. Project requirements included working with React, React Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, testing suites for all components, and working with anAPI of my choosing.

Users can select a specific region of Iceland. Once a region has been selected, they are able to choose from a list of cities in that region. A user can view the current weather conditions for that city. They also have the option to save that city to their favorites. Whenever a user views weather for a specfic city, the current weather condtions are returned in real time.
